# Ironskydive Exercise

**Exercise to recreate a landing page for "IronSkydive" from a picture**

* First I tried to replicate the picture without instructions;

* Then I compared my HTML and CSS to the instructions;

* And finally I implemented some small changes to make the site more visually appealing and cohesive;

The source picture:
